app.js
------------------
require yargs
require geocode.js

const argv - sets up argv variable to call yargs.argv with the options of -a for address

geocode.geocodeAddress calls the geocodeAddress function on the geocode.js file required at the top
geocode.geocodeAddress passes in the address received from the argv.address passed in from terminal
geocode.geocodeAddress passes in a callback function with the arguments errorMessage and results

if an error is passed into geocode.geocodeAddress then the error message will be printed to the console

else undefined is passed in for the error and the results will be passed in as an object
results are then stringified and made pretty with 2 spaces and printed to the console

argv are printed to console
